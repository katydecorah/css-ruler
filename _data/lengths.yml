types:
  - type: font relative
    about: is relative to font-size.
  - type: viewport percentage
    about: is relative to viewport size.
  - type: absolute
    about: is a physical measurement.

lengths:
  - length: em
    type: font-relative
    description: This unit represents the calculated font-size of the element. If used on the font-size property itself, it represents the inherited font-size of the element.
  - length: ex
    type: font-relative
    description: This unit represents the x-height of the element's font. On fonts with the 'x' letter, this is generally the height of lowercase letters in the font; 1ex ≈ 0.5em in many fonts.
  - length: ch
    type: font-relative
    description: This unit represents the width, or more precisely the advance measure, of the glyph '0' (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's font.
  - length: rem
    type: font-relative
    description: This unit represents the font-size of the root element (e.g. the font-size of the <html> element). When used on the font-size on this root element, it represents its initial value.
  - length: cap
    type: font-relative
    description: (Experimental) Represents the cap height (nominal height of capital letters) of the element’s font.
  - length: ic
    type: font-relative
    description: (Experimental) Equal to the used advance measure of the 水 (CJK water ideograph, U+6C34) glyph found in the font used to render it.
  - length: lh
    type: font-relative
    description: (Experimental) Equal to the computed value of the line-height property of the element on which it is used, converted to an absolute length.
  - length: rlh
    type: font-relative
    description: (Experimental) Equal to the computed value of the line-height property on the root element (typically <html>), converted to an absolute length. When used on the font-size or line-height properties of the root element, it refers to the properties' initial value.

  - length: vh
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: 1% of viewport’s height.
  - length: vw
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: 1% of viewport’s width.
  - length: vmin
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: 1% of viewport’s smaller dimension.
  - length: vmax
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: 1% of viewport’s larger dimension.
  - length: vi
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: (Experimental) Equal to 1% of the size of the initial containing block, in the direction of the root element’s inline axis.
  - length: vb
    type: viewport-percentage
    description: (Experimental) Equal to 1% of the size of the initial containing block, in the direction of the root element’s block axis.

  - length: px
    type: absolute
    description: Relative to the viewing device. For screen display, typically one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and very high resolution screens one CSS pixel implies multiple device pixels, so that the number of pixel per inch stays around 96.
  - length: mm
    type: absolute
    description: One millimeter.
  - length: cm
    type: absolute
    description: One centimeter (10 millimeters).
  - length: in
    type: absolute
    description: One inch (2.54 centimeters).
  - length: pt
    type: absolute
    description: One point (which is 1/72 of an inch).
  - length: pc
    type: absolute
    description: One pica (which is 12 points).
  - length: Q
    type: absolute
    description: (Experimental) One quarter of a millimeter. 1Q = 1/40th of 1cm.

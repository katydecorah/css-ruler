types:
- type: font relative
  about: is relative to font-size.
- type: viewport percentage
  about: is relative to viewport size.
- type: absolute
  about: is a physical measurement.

lengths:
- length: em
  type: font-relative
  description: This unit represents the calculated font-size of the element. If used on the font-size property itself, it represents the inherited font-size of the element.
- length: ex
  type: font-relative
  description: This unit represents the x-height of the element's font. On fonts with the 'x' letter, this is generally the height of lowercase letters in the font; 1ex ≈ 0.5em in many fonts.
- length: ch
  type: font-relative
  description: This unit represents the width, or more precisely the advance measure, of the glyph '0' (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's font.
- length: rem
  type: font-relative
  description: This unit represents the font-size of the root element (e.g. the font-size of the <html> element). When used on the font-size on this root element, it represents its initial value.
- length: cap
  type: font-relative
  description: (Experimental) Represents the cap height (nominal height of capital letters) of the element’s font.
- length: ic
  type: font-relative
  description: (Experimental) Equal to the used advance measure of the 水 (CJK water ideograph, U+6C34) glyph found in the font used to render it.
- length: 1h
  type: font-relative
  description: (Experimental) Equal to the computed value of the line-height property of the element on which it is used, converted to an absolute length.
- length: r1h
  type: font-relative
  description: (Experimental) Equal to the computed value of the line-height property on the root element (typically <html>), converted to an absolute length. When used on the font-size or line-height properties of the root element, it refers to the properties' initial value.


- length: vh
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: 1% of viewport’s height.
- length: vw
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: 1% of viewport’s width.
- length: vmin
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: 1% of viewport’s smaller dimension.
- length: vmax
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: 1% of viewport’s larger dimension.
- length: vi
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: (Experimental) Equal to 1% of the size of the initial containing block, in the direction of the root element’s inline axis.
- length: vb
  type: viewport-percentage
  description: (Experimental) Equal to 1% of the size of the initial containing block, in the direction of the root element’s block axis.

- length: px
  type: absolute
  description: Relative to the viewing device. For screen display, typically one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and very high resolution screens one CSS pixel implies multiple device pixels, so that the number of pixel per inch stays around 96.
- length: mm
  type: absolute
  description: One millimeter.
- length: cm
  type: absolute
  description: One centimeter (10 millimeters).
- length: in
  type: absolute
  description: One inch (2.54 centimeters).
- length: pt
  type: absolute
  description: One point (which is 1/72 of an inch).
- length: pc
  type: absolute
  description: One pica (which is 12 points).
- length: Q
  type: absolute
  description: (Experimental) One quarter of a millimeter. 1Q = 1/40th of 1cm.
- length: mozmm
  type: absolute
  description: (Experimental) Attempts to render at exactly one millimeter regardless of the size or resolution of the display. This is rarely actually what you want, but may be useful in particular for mobile devices

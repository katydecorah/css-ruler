### What about percentage?

[According to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Summary):

> Please note that although `<percentage>` values are also CSS dimensions and are accepted by some CSS properties that accept `<length>` values, they are not themselves, `<length>` values.
